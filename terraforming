TERRAFORMING (working title)

STORY
Set in a post-apocolyptic world, the player must fight their way to the surface whilst working to make the environment habitable again. There will be multiple layers of narrative which tie into some underlying theme that is yet to be decided.

GAMEPLAY
The gameplay combines aspects of Boulderdash (digging underground, rolling boulders, crushing enemies) with Worms (destructable terrain, weapons), and traditional 2D platforming. Within underground open spaces where gravity affects the player, platforming dynamics apply. These areas will be interspersed within 'diggable' terrain in which Boulderdash dynamics apply. Not all weapons are available from the start, and so finding and collecting them adds an RPG dimension to the gameplay.

Gameplay involves collecting valuable minerals and rolling boulders into large machinary, and terraforming the terrain either directly or via scripted story events. The game contains a large array of weaponry with which to destroy enemies.
